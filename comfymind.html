                        <p><strong>Demographics:</strong>

                            Tech-savvy professional
                            Busy lifestyle, values efficiency
                            Uses smartphone for most daily tasks</p>

                        <strong>Goals:</strong>
                        <p>
                           Meera aims to create a balanced lifestyle that nurtures both her mental and physical health. As a remote UX designer, she spends long hours in front of screens and wants a mindful way to disconnect after work. Her goals include tracking her moods to understand emotional patterns, using meditation as a relaxation tool, and building a sustainable self-care routine through small, rewarding activities like hydration, exercise, and brief social interactions.</p>

                        <strong>Pain Points:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Despite her interest in mindfulness, Meera often feels frustrated with current apps in the market. Many offer too many features, have cluttered interfaces, or require expensive subscriptions to unlock basic meditation tools. She dislikes apps that commercialize wellness instead of offering genuine emotional support. Meera needs a calming, minimal, and affordable solution that adapts to her flexible work schedule — a companion app that feels personal, beautiful, and easy to integrate into her daily rhythm.</p>

                        <h3>Ankit Sharma</h3>
                        <p>Age: 19 | Occupation: Student | Location: Suburban area</p>
                        <p><strong>Demographics:</strong>
                        Ankit is a final-year engineering student juggling academics, internships, and social commitments. He often feels stressed due to academic pressure and uncertain career goals. He has tried journaling and productivity apps but finds them time-consuming and overwhelming. Ankit wants a lightweight, private app that helps him manage his mood and build positive daily habits without adding more pressure.</p>

                        <strong>Goals:</strong>
                        <p>
                        Ankit’s primary goal is to maintain his emotional well-being while balancing the stress of college life. He wants a simple, private way to track his mood without having to write lengthy journal entries or maintain daily streaks. Instead, he prefers quick, emoji-based check-ins and small, achievable wellness tasks like drinking water, meditating, or exercising. Ankit hopes to build healthy habits at his own pace and receive gentle reminders rather than pressure-driven notifications.</p>

                        <strong>Pain Points:</strong>
                        <p>
                            However, he finds most existing wellness apps too complex or intrusive. They often overwhelm him with analytics, badges, or streaks that make him feel guilty when he skips a day. He’s also concerned about data privacy and doesn’t want his personal feelings stored or shared on cloud platforms. For Ankit, a successful app must feel emotionally safe, lightweight, and encouraging — something that quietly supports him instead of adding more to his to-do list.</p>
